Misc notes about code size.

The default compiler settings provide quite good size optimizations.
If you still aren't happy - read further.

board.c
It is a good idea to replace the beautiful get/set code with a bunch
of SET_REGS with magic numbers. It will be less readable, but will
occupy less space.
Only leave boardInit and boardTeardown, or declare other functions
as inline.

config.h
Disable any strobing at all, disable usb suspend code.
Enable only one altsetting that you really need.

The most minimal working config I could get was about 5.9KiB.

VTOR. For the interrupts in your app to work, VTOR register, aka
SCB->VTOR needs to be set to point to the new vector table.
ST's app notes recommend setting this in the application itself,
during init.
ST's periph libs do that in SystemInit(); See their code for details.
It is not necessary here, since the VTOR is set before the jump
by the bootloader automatically and it proves to be working.
It won't hurt setting it again, but if you are running in a memory
constrained system, you can safely omit that.
