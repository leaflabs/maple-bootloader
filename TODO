This is a personal TODO list.

Clean up board init, free up some space *WiP
Do we need different LD script and c_startup for different uCs?? LD for sure!
Generate LD with sizes stuff on-the-fly *WiP
Shut up a shitload of warnings from usb_lib *DONE
Merge here all the CREDITS, Licensing info and other shit *DONE (Somewhat)
Add support for boards: mcortex mctx-dm sISP ucGUN, etc.
Talk with leaflabs, merge&check their boards *WiP
fix coding style!!! *WiP
See if some common usb_descriptors.c parts can be macrofied and moved away from boards. Is it good idea?
