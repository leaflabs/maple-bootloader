These are misc developer hints.

Adding new io targets.
----------------------
The stock maple booloader supported only 2 targets. RAM and FLASH.
However, in my case I needed to add more targets, and made it easy to add new
ones.


You have to do the following.

* In dfu_io.c (located under src/common)
  implement your dfuToSomewhereInit function
  It should set dfuCopyFunc to your dfuToSomewhereCopy implementation, located just here.
  DO wrap it in CONFIG_ALSETTING_SOMEWHERE #ifdef to save space for the others.

* In dfu.c, in dfuUpdateByRequest add the MAP_ALSETTING_INIT macro, wrapped it #ifdefs
  that will call your init function, when a query arrives to the specified altsetting.

* Test it!

* Send the patches
