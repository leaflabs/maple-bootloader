This is a bootloader derived from leaflabs' maple dfu bootloader.
It has a better support for multiple boards, and some other
goodies.
To compile run 'make'
To specify toolchain - use CROSS_COMPILE, e.g.
'CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- make'
Results are piled to build/ directory.
To see what's actually happening - run with V=y, e.g.
CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- make V=y
This will dump a lot of info for you.
Have fun.

WHY?
----
I needed a bootloader for my custom boards. Upstream maple was
shitty in places. So I cleaned up the mess

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, COMPARED TO MAPLE's UPSTREAM ONE?
